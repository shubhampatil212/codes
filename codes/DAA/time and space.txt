1 - timw - 2^n space o(n)
Huffman Encoding - nlogn and space - o(n)
 fractional Knapsack - The time complexity of the fractional knapsack problem using the greedy method is O(n log n) 
due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the items.

The time complexity of the 0-1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming is O(nW), and 
the space complexity is O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the knapsack.

The time complexity of the n-Queens problem using backtracking is O(n!) (factorial time complexity due to the recursive exploration of possible placements for each queen), and the space complexity is O(n^2) for the board storage and the recursion stack.
